### Hi there 👋

Here you can see my pet projects, some test tasks and also some abandoned repos. The list of most 
interesting things here is below.

⚠️ DISCLAIMER: *You have to understand that code in pet projects almost never looks like an ideal production-ready 
code. If you want to know more about my skills – consider discussing my code with me: I'll tell about the problems 
in the code I'm aware of, and also I can tell how to improve it.*

## My pet projects

### Music box drum generator

You can create your custom music box easily, just create a music track in MIDI file format and [use this app](https://github.com/pashawnn/midi_to_music_box)!

### Flappy bird clone 

This is a flappy bird clone that uses Pygame, written [in Python](https://github.com/pashawnn/pygame_flappybird/)
during my voluntary activity as a Python teacher for kids.

### Boids simulation

Works [in the browser](https://pashawnn.github.io/boids_go/) (except Safari :c)
Written [in Go](https://github.com/PashaWNN/boids_go) using WASM

### Cellular automata fluid simulation

It was created as an university task. Written 
[in Go](https://github.com/PashaWNN/cellular_liquid), works 
[in browsers](https://pashawnn.github.io/cellular_liquid/) 
(except Safari) using WASM.

### Python paint app

Another university task. A very basic raster editor written [in Python](https://github.com/pashawnn/python_paint/).

### Raytracer port C++ -> Python

The original was [tinyraytracer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer). 
I've ported it [to Python](https://github.com/PashaWNN/raytracing) just for fun.

### Ray marching

Ray marching rendering algorithm implementation
 [in Python](https://github.com/PashaWNN/raymarching) and
  [in Go](https://github.com/PashaWNN/raymarching_go).

Inspired by [this](https://habr.com/post/353422/) article on Habr.

## Final qualifying work from the university (Russian only)

A small django-based web application for automating testing students code. It uses Docker
to create one-time sandboxes and run students code. The app allows teachers to configure
different sandboxes and to create tasks for students.

It is located [here](https://github.com/PashaWNN/UnitTestStudent).
